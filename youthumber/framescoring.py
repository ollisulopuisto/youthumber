"""Pure scoring helpers for picking expressive video frames — no Vision calls here.

Inputs come from Apple Vision (face landmarks, hand pose, body pose) already turned
into plain tuples. Coordinates are Vision's: normalized 0–1, origin bottom-left, y up.
Face landmark points are relative to the face's own bounding box.

The thresholds below are hand-set from Vision's coordinate ranges, not tuned on real
footage yet — expect decent but imperfect ranking.
